**JERSERN**  
jersern parses Json to C# classes.  
It is a Windows Forms project using .Net 6.  
So far it works.   

To run, clone the project down, build the project in Visual Studio and run. 
To install, right click the project in VS and publish it. 
From there, go to the publish folder in /bin/release and run the setup.exe file. 
This is obviously the default and needs to be polished.
