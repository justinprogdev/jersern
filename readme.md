**JERSERN**  
jersern parses Json to C# classes.  
It is a Windows Forms project using .Net 6.  
So far it works.   

To run, clone the project down, build the project in Visual Studio and run. 
To install, right click the project in VS and publish it. 
From there, go to the publish folder in /bin/release and run the setup.exe file. 
This is obviously the default and needs to be polished. 

To use, paste json in the left pane. Classes will appear in the right pane. 
There is an example.json in the solution file to try out.
